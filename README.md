# frontend-boilerplate

A simple, opinionated front-end boilerplate to help kick-off your projects and save you some hours.

Basically it's a frankenstein mix of HTML5 BoilerPlate, plus Sanitize CSS, Bourbon &amp; Neat, as well as some base line CSS styles and an automated build process using Gulp JS.

Still a work in progress.

### To Do's

Clean Up CSS

Add some Base CSS styles (buttons, helper mixins, typography styles, tables, forms, etc)

All JS, CSS, & IMG files are in the /SRC folder - rearrange / edit / delete to your liking
